Project Description: Apotheosis will be a game similar to Slay the Spire which is a roguelike, turn based card game focused on ascending a tower of enemies and eventually reaching the summit. Cards must be synergistic and enemies will lead up to a boss encounter either ending the game or continuing with multiple acts/towers. Resting areas and merchants would be scattered among the ascent, offering players the chance to heal, improve their deck, and purchase new card options from vendors. Permanent deck upgrades can be earned through bosses, and one character will be available with multiple path options to choose from; these alter the weight and appearance rate of suitable cards to appear for your character.

Game concept: Turn based card game
Genre: Roguelike
Core Mechanics: Deck building, card synergies, merchants, bosses, card costs
    Mana: Card costs

Story: TBD

Characters: Knight, Mage

    Knight:
        Default Attack: Slash
            Single target damage, low cost, higher card weight.
        Default Defense: Block
            Adds an amount of Guard, which reduces damage from enemy attacks. More similar to an overshield.

        AoE Ability: Cleave
            Deals more damage to a single enemy and some damage to adjacent enemies.

    Items:
        Can be bought from merchants, looted after battles.

        Potion: 
            Heals a small amount of health, can be used once per battle.
        
        Mana Potion:
            Restores a small amount of mana, can be used once per battle.

Levels: 1: Cave, 2: Forest, 3: Mountain, 4: Castle, 5: Heaven
